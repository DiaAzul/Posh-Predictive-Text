                              [package_name ...]

Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.

    This command will also remove any package that depends on any of the
    specified packages as well---unless a replacement can be found without
    that dependency. If you wish to skip this dependency checking and remove
    just the requested packages, add the '--force' option. Note however that
    this may result in a broken environment, so use this with caution.

Options:

positional arguments:
  package_name          Package names to remove from the environment.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  --dev                 Use `sys.executable -m conda` in wrapper scripts
                        instead of CONDA_EXE. This is mainly for use during
                        tests where we test new conda source against old
                        Python versions.

Target Environment Specification:
  -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                        Name of environment.
  -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                        Full path to environment location (i.e. prefix).

Channel Customization:
  -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                        Additional channel to search for packages. These are
                        URLs searched in the order they are given (including
                        local directories using the 'file://' syntax or simply
                        a path like '/home/conda/mychan' or '../mychan').
                        Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc are
                        searched (unless --override-channels is given). You
                        can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for
                        conda. You can also use any name and the .condarc
                        channel_alias value will be prepended. The default
                        channel_alias is https://conda.anaconda.org/.
  --use-local           Use locally built packages. Identical to '-c local'.
  --override-channels   Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires
                        --channel.
  --repodata-fn REPODATA_FNS
                        Specify name of repodata on remote server. Conda will
                        try whatever you specify, but will ultimately fall
                        back to repodata.json if your specs are not
                        satisfiable with what you specify here. This is used
                        to employ repodata that is reduced in time scope. You
                        may pass this flag more than once. Leftmost entries
                        are tried first, and the fallback to repodata.json is
                        added for you automatically.

Solver Mode Modifiers:
  --all                 Remove all packages, i.e., the entire environment.
  --features            Remove features (instead of packages).
  --force-remove, --force
                        Forces removal of a package without removing packages
                        that depend on it. Using this option will usually
                        leave your environment in a broken and inconsistent
                        state.
  --no-pin              Ignore pinned file.
  --experimental-solver {classic,libmamba,libmamba-draft}
                        EXPERIMENTAL. Choose which solver backend to use.

Networking Options:
  -C, --use-index-cache
                        Use cache of channel index files, even if it has
                        expired.
  -k, --insecure        Allow conda to perform "insecure" SSL connections and
                        transfers. Equivalent to setting 'ssl_verify' to
                        'false'.
  --offline             Offline mode. Don't connect to the Internet.

Output, Prompt, and Flow Control Options:
  -d, --dry-run         Only display what would have been done.
  --json                Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda
                        programmatically.
  -q, --quiet           Do not display progress bar.
  -v, --verbose         Can be used multiple times. Once for INFO, twice for
                        DEBUG, three times for TRACE.
  -y, --yes             Do not ask for confirmation.

Examples:

    conda remove -n myenv scipy
