usage: conda-script.py run [-h] [-n ENVIRONMENT | -p PATH] [-v] [--dev]
                           [--debug-wrapper-scripts] [--cwd CWD]
                           [--no-capture-output] [--live-stream]
                           ...

Run an executable in a conda environment.

Example usage::

    $ conda create -y -n my-python-env python=3
    $ conda run -n my-python-env python --version

Options:

positional arguments:
  executable_call       Executable name, with additional arguments to be
                        passed to the executable on invocation.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --verbose         Use once for info, twice for debug, three times for
                        trace.
  --dev                 Sets `CONDA_EXE` to `python -m conda`, assuming the
                        CWD contains the root of conda development sources.
                        This is mainly for use during tests where we test new
                        conda source against old Python versions.
  --debug-wrapper-scripts
                        When this is set, where implemented, the shell wrapper
                        scriptswill echo to stderr a lot of debugging
                        information.
  --cwd CWD             Current working directory for command to run in.
                        Defaults to cwd
  --no-capture-output   Don't capture stdout/stderr
  --live-stream         Display the output for the subprocess stdout and
                        stderr on real time.

Target Environment Specification:
  -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                        Name of environment.
  -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                        Full path to environment location (i.e. prefix).
