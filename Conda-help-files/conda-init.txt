usage: conda-script.py init [-h] [--all] [--reverse] [--anaconda-prompt]
                            [--json] [-v] [-q] [-d]
                            [shells ...]

Initialize conda for shell interaction. [Experimental]

Options:

positional arguments:
  shells             One or more shells to be initialized. If not given, the
                     default value is 'bash' on unix and 'cmd.exe' on Windows.
                     Use the '--all' flag to initialize all shells. Currently
                     compatible shells are {bash, cmd.exe, fish, powershell,
                     tcsh, xonsh, zsh}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.
  --all              Initialize all currently available shells.
  --anaconda-prompt  Add an 'Anaconda Prompt' icon to your desktop.
  -d, --dry-run      Only display what would have been done.

setup type:
  --reverse          Undo past effects of conda init.

Output, Prompt, and Flow Control Options:
  --json             Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda
                     programmatically.
  -v, --verbose      Use once for info, twice for debug, three times for
                     trace.
  -q, --quiet        Do not display progress bar.

Key parts of conda's functionality require that it interact directly with the shell
within which conda is being invoked. The `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` commands
specifically are shell-level commands. That is, they affect the state (e.g. environment
variables) of the shell context being interacted with. Other core commands, like
`conda create` and `conda install`, also necessarily interact with the shell environment.
They're therefore implemented in ways specific to each shell. Each shell must be configured
to make use of them.

This command makes changes to your system that are specific and customized for each shell.
To see the specific files and locations on your system that will be affected before, use the
'--dry-run' flag.  To see the exact changes that are being or will be made to each location,
use the '--verbose' flag.

IMPORTANT: After running `conda init`, most shells will need to be closed and restarted
           for changes to take effect.
